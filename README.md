## Getting Started

To get started, install Node.js 7 or later.

If you have another version of Node.js installed, you can install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [N](https://github.com/tj/n). NVM seems to have a more active community than N, and the instructor uses NVM so NVM is recommended.
